# {frontmatter.title}

I made a `<Link/>` component cause I didn't want to have to switch between `gatsby-link` and `<a/>` nor remember all the props like `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

Basically it's doing automagical stuff so I don't have to think ðŸ¤“

- Uses Gatsby's `<Link/>` for all internal links otherwise a normal `<a/>`.
- Sets the `activeClassName` prop if it's internal and well active ðŸ˜‰
- External links will automatically open in a new tab via `target="_blank"`.
- And to safe us all `rel="noopener noreferrer"` will be set as well ðŸ™Œ
- The url can be defined via `href` or `to`, so I don't have to think again ðŸ¤¯
- Lets me define a `title` otherwise uses the url.
- Ensures an external link is not just an anchor.
- Accepts a variant string, used to style the link via [Theme UI].
- I can manually set a link to be external or not.
- Passes all other props to the html element.
- All props can be overriden as `{...props}` are passed last.

ðŸš€

All links in markdown will use my `<Link/>` component via [gatsby-plugin-theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/#components)

```js title=components.js size=content
import { Link } from "components/Link";
export default {
  a: Link,
  Link,
};
```

Now you may understand why it accepts both `href` and `to` ðŸ˜‰

It used to also set `nofollow`, I just removed it tho. I don't remember when nor why I added it actually and currently I think it's nice to share link juice. Even tho this blog is still not relevant^^

Would it make sense to have such a component available via npm, or is it too specific? I mean I think I'm going to publish it someday anyway, most probably scoped, as I don't want to miss it anymore. ðŸ’› Now that I've remembered myself, I'll probably publish it sooner than later ðŸ˜…

I wish everyone a beautiful and relaxing weekend ðŸ˜˜
