# Improving SEO: Adding & Submitting a Sitemap

Usually I publish a website with sitemap and submit it to Google Search Console as soon as possible.

This blog, as it's meant to be a playground, gave me the chance to just watch what happens in 2020 when I don't submit it and don't even generate a sitemap.xml.

## The Outcome?

Looks like Google came because of some tweets or Reddit posts, indexed a few more pages (probably everything it could find) and never came back ðŸ˜…

## Solution?

I just pushed 1.7.0 including `gatsby-plugin-sitemap` and then submitted the sitemap to [Search Console].
That should improve indexing from now on, we'll see.

You can check out the [diff on GitHub](https://github.com/GaiAma/Coding4GaiAma/commit/b8061620dd14aaee372818882573edd48d5d40da#diff-9063b1f2faa2c7c6bdd6261b25876358) to see what exactly happened.

This post is not meant as proper SEO research or tutorial. It's just a public note and future reference. ðŸ˜‰
