## Listen to the instructions

<audio controls src={audioVersion} />

## Using a desktop browser

1. Go to your [private messages](https://twitter.com/messages/) in Twitter
   `https://twitter.com/messages/`
2. Click on a few chats and compare the IDs in the URL
   `https://twitter.com/messages/id1-id2`
3. Identify which ID stays the same
4. Congrats, this is your personal Twitter User ID ðŸ¥³

## Why?

I've stumbled upon this cool link on the website https://danestves.com by [@danestves](https://twitter.com/danestves) which opens a private chat on Twitter with the specified `recipient` in this case Daniel of course.

As I like the idea of using deep-links like this or direct share URLs which don't require JavaScript I decided to add it to my page.

Only problem was that I didn't know my Twitter User ID ðŸ˜³ and all tutorials I've found wouldn't work anymore because of design changes in the Twitter frontend.

Alternatives were trusting a website with my data (I know it's public but anyway) or using the Twitter API myself, which I haven't started using yet ðŸ˜…

You can try it out using **PM via Twitter** link right below this post. ðŸ’¬
