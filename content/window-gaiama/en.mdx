# {frontmatter.title}

This website exposes `window.GaiAma` accessible via the console. It's not really anything useful (yet 🤔) but I kinda liked the idea to share some internals/meta data.

Most interesting right now, I think, is the `ThemeUI` object, containing data from `useThemeUI` hook, it even let's you change the color mode via `window.GaiAma.ThemeUI.setColorMode()` 😁 and `perf` providing some performance metrics.

By the way, the console is worth a look anyway 😎

I used to define almost all of those via [gatsby-browser.js] until I came across the SSR hook `onRenderBody` which lets me predefine `window.GaiAma` at build time so I don't have to always

```js
window.GaiAma = {
  ...window.GaiAma,
  foo: "bar",
};
```

Now I can just attach whatever data from wherever I want to the already existing object like in the [layout file]

Now I just spoiled my little easter egg 😅

I think I'll add more data to it, now that I'm writing about it, why isn't it already sharing stuff like Gatsby and other dependency versions etc 🧐😅 Couldn't help myself, so this paragraph is already obsolete 😎.

Uh and if you've wondered what that weird mess at the top of [gatsby-browser.js] is all about, check out [babel-plugin-preval] by [Kent C. Dodds]. It's a nifty little babel plugin which "Pre-evaluate code at build-time" as the the repo description states correctly.
