As I'm building my CMS I started today to work in the storage API for static assets like images.

I wanted to give [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html#af9xh2) a try though my current internet solution blocks a "few things" for whatever reasons, seems in this case that only some JS resources on B2's login site won't load which means I can't log in 😓 So I'm falling back to AWS S3 for now until I get that fixed 🤞

Anyway as I was setting up the bucket I wanted to map it to my own domain and decided it's finally time to get Cloudflare running

## Granting only Cloudflare access to AWS S3 private bucket

```json

          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Fix SSL issues

Add a Page Rule to Cloudflare

```
assets.canrau.com/*
SSL: Flexible, Cache Level: Cache Everything
```

## Verify that Cloudflare is working

Using those sites I verified that Cloudflare is actually serving my website
https://www.cloudflare.com/diagnostic-center/
https://checkforcloudflare.selesti.com
Though developer tools in Firefox took a little longer to show Cloudflare headers and Brotli compression, which was probably due to Firefox caching DNS entries.

## Cloudflare Web Analytics and GDPR

As Cloudflare Web Analytics is not using cookies it is actually GDPR compliant without needing a cookie banner.

From the [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics)

> Cloudflare Web Analytics provides free, privacy-first analytics for your website [..].

> Cloudflare Web Analytics does not collect or use your visitors’ personal data.

## Gandi.net Mail with Cloudflare DNS

After logging into [admin.gandi.net](https://admin.gandi.net) and creating an email account, Gandi will show the required DNS settings (if you've already pointed your nameservers to Cloudflare).

> They're also available from Gandis Docs [MX Records](https://docs.gandi.net/en/domain_names/faq/record_types/mx_record.html), [DKIM, SPF, DMARC](https://docs.gandi.net/en/gandimail/common_operations/enable_antispoofing_tools.html) and more optional [SRV Records](https://docs.gandi.net/en/gandimail/standard_email_settings/index.html#srv-records). Note that even though Gandi specifically mentions the trailing dot, it works perfectly fine without as Cloudflare manages that during lookups ([reference comment in Cloudflare Community](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/i-could-not-receive-email-after-i-moved-my-dns-to-cloudflare/109431/2?u=canrau))

### Quick setup

The easiest way, also avoiding any typos or misconfigurations, is by copying the following into a `.txt` file, changing `dmarc-report@your.domain` in line 4 (beginning with `_dmarc`) to an email address of you choice and then in the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) DNS settings of your domain, tap on **advanced** next to "Add record" and drag the saved and modified `.txt` file into the dashed area.

```txt
@ 10800 IN MX 10 spool.mail.gandi.net.
@ 10800 IN MX 50 fb.mail.gandi.net.
@ 10800 IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_mailcust.gandi.net ?all"
_dmarc 10800 IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=25; rua=mailto:dmarc-report@your.domain"
_imap._tcp 10800 IN SRV 0 0 0   .
_imaps._tcp 10800 IN SRV 0 1 993 mail.gandi.net.
_pop3._tcp 10800 IN SRV 0 0 0   .
_pop3s._tcp 10800 IN SRV 10 1 995 mail.gandi.net.
_submission._tcp 10800 IN SRV 0 1 465 mail.gandi.net.
```

> Note to self, add API code example, maybe a Deno CLI and/or Pulumi script!
