I just stumbled upon [The danger of open redirects!](https://scotthelme.co.uk/the-danger-of-open-redirects/) by [Scott Helme](https://twitter.com/Scott_Helme) a security researcher from the UK.

## What are Open-Redirects and how can they be abused?

from https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/open-redirect-vulnerabilities-netsparker-pauls-security-weekly/

## Solutions

> Force all redirects to first go through a page notifying users that they are going off of your site, with the destination clearly displayed, and have them click a link to confirm.

Especially if you're a bigger organisation it might be good to provide a [security.txt](https://scotthelme.co.uk/say-hello-to-security-txt/) to help researchers get easier in touch with the right people.
