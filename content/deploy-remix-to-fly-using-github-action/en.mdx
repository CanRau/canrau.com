## fly.io access token

When you've [registered for an account with fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up), you can go to your [account settings](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens) to get yourself an active token.

Click on the "Create access token" button and give it a descriptive name, I named mine "gh_worker_canrau.com".

Copy the token (it's the only time you'll get to see it) and then go to your GitHub repository's settings, and select "Secrets" in the left menu then click on "New repository secret".

{/*the URL should look like `https://github.com/<YOUR_ACCOUNT>/<REPO_NAME>/settings/secrets/actions`*/}

__OR__

<UserUrl initial="user/repo" prefix="https://github.com/" suffix="/settings/secrets/actions/new" />

Give it the name `FLY_API_TOKEN` and value of the before copied access token you've got from fly.io, click "Add secret" and your done.

## GitHub Action

Works with NPM & Yarn

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deployment.yml

name: Deploy to Fly üöÄ
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy proxy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Although I'm not building that often, so far
      # it seems pretty useful to have in place,
      # for example when trying to debug something you need to deploy üßë‚Äçüîß
      - name: üõë Cancel Previous Runs
        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.6.0
        with:
          access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      # This step checks out a copy of your repository.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: ‚éî Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: üì• Download deps
        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1

      - name: ‚öôÔ∏è Build
        run: yarn build
        env:
          # The `COMMIT_SHA` environment variable is not necessary
          # if you don't want to access it from your remix app
          # I reference it in my websites footer and link it to the GitHub commit ü§ì
          COMMIT_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}

      # This step runs `fly(ctl) deploy`.
      - name: Deploy
        uses: superfly/flyctl-actions@master
        env:
          FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
        with:
          # actually I'm not sure the former `COMMIT_SHA` was really necessary (at least in my case)
          # as this one here should be sufficient
          args: "deploy --build-arg COMMIT_SHA=${{ github.sha }}"
```

This is a pretty basic build+deploy workflow.

I'm going to keep it updated with my [actual Action](https://github.com/CanRau/canrau.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployment.yml).

If you want more inspiration on what you can do with your Remix app in a GitHub Action, check out Kent C. Dodds [deployment.yml](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployment.yml), this is also where I got mine from. üòá

## Cloudflare Workers

If you're using Cloudflare Workers you might get results with [this workflow](https://github.com/edmundhung/remix-worker-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) I've found in the [Remix Discord](https://discord.com/channels/770287896669978684/777863813981536280/920759269534597170). Not using Workers so can't vouch for it.
