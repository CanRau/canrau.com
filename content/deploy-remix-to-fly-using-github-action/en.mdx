## fly.io access token

When you've [registered for an account with fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up), you can go to your [account settings](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens) to get yourself an active token.

Click on the "Create access token" button and give it a descriptive name, I named mine "gh_worker_canrau.com".

Copy the token (it's the only time you'll get to see it) and then go to your GitHub repository's settings, and select "Secrets" in the left menu then click on "New repository secret".

{/* the URL should look like `https://github.com/<YOUR_ACCOUNT>/<REPO_NAME>/settings/secrets/actions` */}

**OR**

<UserUrl
  placeholder="user/repo"
  prefix="https://github.com/"
  suffix="/settings/secrets/actions/new"
/>

Give it the name `FLY_API_TOKEN` and value of the before copied access token you've got from fly.io, click "Add secret" and your done.

## GitHub Action

This one is independent of your package manager, it just cancels any previous builds, checks out your repo and tells fly to build it. So it completely depends on it beeing fly.io compatible, probably via a `Dockerfile`.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deployment.yml

name: 🚀 Deploy to Fly 🚀
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request: {}

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: 🚀 Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Although I'm not building that often, so far
      # it seems pretty useful to have in place,
      # for example when trying to debug something you need to deploy 🧑‍🔧
      - name: 🛑 Cancel Previous Runs
        uses: styfle/cancel-workflow-action@0.9.1

      # This step checks out a copy of your repository.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # This step runs `fly(ctl) deploy`.
      - name: 🚀 Deploy
        uses: superfly/flyctl-actions@master
        env:
          FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: "deploy --build-arg COMMIT_SHA=${{ github.sha }}"
```

> Updated to reflect the PR [#3](https://github.com/CanRau/canrau.com/pull/3) by [@MichaelDeBoey93](https://twitter.com/MichaelDeBoey93) which updates `styfle/cancel-workflow-action` from `0.6.0` to `0.9.1` and defaults to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` so no need to pass it manually - Thanks 🙏

I'm going to keep it updated with my [actual Action](https://github.com/CanRau/canrau.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployment.yml).

If you want more inspiration on what you can do with your Remix app in a GitHub Action, check out [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) [deployment.yml](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kentcdodds.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/deployment.yml), this is also where I got mine from. 😇

## Cloudflare Workers

If you're using Cloudflare Workers you might get results with [this workflow](https://github.com/edmundhung/remix-worker-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) I've found in the [Remix Discord](https://discord.com/channels/770287896669978684/777863813981536280/920759269534597170). Not using Workers so can't vouch for it.
