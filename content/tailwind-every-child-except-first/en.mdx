# {frontmatter.title}

So I can add a `margin-top` to all the list items except the first

```html
<ul className="not-first:mt-20">
  <li>Without Margin</li>
  <li>With Margin</li>
  <li>With Margin the second</li>
</ul>
```

To get this working I added the following to my `tailwind.config.js` file, though the `notFirst` plugin function part could of course be out-sourced into a separate file.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require("tailwindcss/plugin");

const notFirst = plugin(({ addVariant, e }) => {
  addVariant("not-first", ({ modifySelectors, separator }) => {
    modifySelectors(({ className }) => {
      const element = e(`not-first${separator}${className}`);
      return `.${element} > :not(:first-child)`;
    });
  });
});

module.exports = {
  plugins: [notFirst],
};
```

> Note the `>` which is the [child combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator) to ensure it's only targeting the direct children and not children's-children

And alternative to `:not(:first-child)` would be to use the [adjacent sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator) which works in CSS like so

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```css
ul > li + li {}
```

and in the Tailwind plugin you would rewrite the return statement in line 8 to

```ts
return `.${element} > * + *`;
```

## More research can help find conventions

Then I stumbled upon Tailwinds [space between utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space#add-vertical-space-between-children) and [divide utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/divide-width#add-borders-between-stacked-children) (to do the same thing with a border) via [tailwindcss/discussions#2156](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/2156).

So digging deeper helped me find that it's already possible and I like to stick to existing solutions wherever possible, if I don't "dislike" them for whatever reason ðŸ¤“

## Why `margin-top` in the first place?

Ever since I stumbled upon (I think) this article (https://css-tricks.com/margin-bottom-margin-top/) I prefer to use `margin-top` over `margin-bottom`, though both work if you stick to one and/or keep well in mind of [margin's collapse](https://css-tricks.com/what-you-should-know-about-collapsing-margins/)
