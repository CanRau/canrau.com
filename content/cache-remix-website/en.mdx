## Intro

So far this site is pretty un-cached, besides Cloudflare in front of it. Which, because I didn't specify any cache headers, does only cache `.css` & `.js` files (more at [Cloudflare Docs: Default cached file extensions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/default-cache-behavior/#default-cached-file-extensions)).

This means, that the pages content, which is read from the local filesystem and then transformed via mdx-bundler from plaintext `.mdx` files to HTML and that on every request.

So this site was actually always pretty slow üò≥ And I'm sorry I might've shed some doubts on Remix's speed üò¨ Sorry Remix! üôè
