Just came across this awesome piece of CSS by [madebymike.com](https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/fluid-type-calc-examples/)

```css{7}
:root {
  font-size: 0.875rem;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 20rem) {
  :root {
    font-size: calc(0.875rem + 0.5 * ((100vw - 20rem) / 60));
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 80rem) {
  :root {
    font-size: 1.1rem;
  }
}
```

Line 7 is where all the magic happens. ðŸ¦„
The rest ensure minimum and maximum sizes so it won't shrink or grow infinitely.

I'm using this exact piece of CSS on this page, so please let me know if you encounter any font-size related issues.
Hopefully you can read this note ðŸ¤ž
