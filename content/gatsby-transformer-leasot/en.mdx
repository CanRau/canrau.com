> 2020-02-29 v1.2.0 adds `internalType` setting

I finally published [gatsby-transformer-leasot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-transformer-leasot) üéâ I started working on this half a year ago I believe, yet couldn't manage to bring it to a state I'd feel comfortable releasing. In the last couple of days I could spare some time improving the API, convert it to Typescript üöÄ and improve the docs.

## So what does it do?

It extracts all comments in provided source files like the following

```js size=content
// TODO: water the seedlings
```

and makes them available to you via GrapqhQL as accessible object containing the comment along useful information.

```json size=content
{
  "todo": {
    "ref": "",
    "line": 1,
    "value": "find a more concise way",
    "file": {
      "relativePath": "gatsby-config.js"
    }
  }
}
```

## How to install it

```bash size=content
yarn add -D gatsby-transformer-leasot
# or
npm i -D gatsby-transformer-leasot
```

It **requires: [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem)**, this way you can use a separate instance to define which files to source only used by gatsby-transformer-leasot.  
You can use [gatsby-theme-leasot](https://github.com/GaiAma/Coding4GaiAma/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-leasot) for convenience.  
Alternatively, since v1.2.0, you can bring your own source plugin and set the `internalType` accordingly.

## How to configure it

```js title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: __dirname,
        name: `leasot`,
        ignore: [
          /\.*.*\/(node_modules|\.cache|public|static|dist|\.yarn)\/./,
          /\.*.\.(log|jpe?g|png|gif|ico|json|map|gz|pdf)/,
        ],
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-leasot`,
  ],
};
```

That's the minimum required setup using the defaults.

## How to query

```graphql
allLeasot(
  sort: { fields: [todo___modifiedTime], order: DESC }
) {
  group(field: todo___tag) {
    fieldValue
    totalCount
    nodes {
      id
      todo {
        tag
        line
        ref
        value
        modifiedTime(formatString: "YYYY-MM-DD H:mm") # More about modifiedTime below
        file {
          relativePath
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The name `allLeasot` depends on the provided `sourceInstanceName` in the configs. So when you change it you have to change the `name` option of gatsby-source-filesystem accordingly, lets say `todo` then you query for `allTodo` or `todo` if you just want a single one.

## All config options

```

> All by default supported languages (file extensions) can be found in [Leasot's Readme](https://github.com/pgilad/leasot/#supported-languages)

## More examples

```js size=content
// FIXME(Reference): improve example
// TODO: you can add a reference like this as well /Reference
// TODO: example without reference
```

## Sadly

Even though the `node` in GraphQL also provides `modifiedTime` of the file it's currently only locally useful as file times will all be the same on CI. I don't have an easy fix for that so far.

## Alternative todo lists

I've installed & tried VSCode extensions like [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) and some others yet never really remember to let them generate the list to see my notes. Global search could work, too. Yet I find this automatic integration much more pleasing. And making it public kinda helps at least trying to get back to those notes so they won't stick around forever üòÖ. Let's see how that goes ü§ì.

## The near future

This website is not only meant as my / GaiAma's dev knowledge base, but as a playground and place to try things out before implementing on GaiAma.org üòâ

My next plans are improving the donation experience on GaiAma.org, then, or maybe along that, improving the various open source projects and probably releasing more stuff, not just to share them with others but with myself, too. üòÅ

Some time in the near future I think about merging this repository with GaiAma/gaiama.org, not exactly sure about that though. ü§î One benefit would be that the [roadmap](/en/roadmap) could then easily show GaiAma.org notes as well, without having to source it from GitHub. Just thinking out loud.

## By the way

`truncateLinks` uses [remark-truncate-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-truncate-links) which I open sourced separately. I use it for all MDX content as well. It'll truncate all links not manually named. Go check it out ü§©
