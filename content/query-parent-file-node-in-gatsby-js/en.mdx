# {frontmatter.title}

{/* fixme: get line highlighting working */}

```graphql{7-10}
{
  mdx {
    frontmatter {
      title
    }
    parent {
      ... on File {
        relativePath
        changeTime
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When querying a Markdown/MDX node in GatsbyJS I always wondered how to get information of the parent file and why only `file.absolutePath` has been included as `mdx.fileAbsolutePath`. Then one day I came across some GraphQL magic I didn't fully understand and sadly couldn't remember nor find again. üòÖ

That's the main reason for this post. It serves as a note to myself and hopefully serves others as well as I think it's quite usefull.

Thanks to a [video about the new Facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/) using GraphQL and [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) which showed **inline fragments**, leading me to the right syntax üôè. By the way, I found the video pretty informative to watch including cool techniques to build a more accessible and user friendly web.

Why has only `absolutePath` been added to the md/mdx node?  
I think it's for filtering, because AFAIK you can't use the inline fragment syntax in filters.

More about inline fragments in the [GraphQL Docs](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments).
