# `Deno.run` cmd arguments

```ts
const p = Deno.run({
  cmd: ["echo", "I love 🍉"],
});

// await its completion
await p.status();
```

Which works just as expected, and `echo`'es (prints) the provided text to the terminal.
Though when I wanted my CLI to help me with more complex tasks I run into unexpected behaviour.

I'm using [Fly.io](https://fly.io) to deploy my site using a custom `Dockerfile` and I wanted to include the current git hash into my website so I thought I'd pass it to the `Dockerfile` via a `--build-arg` 🤓

Though confusingly the following makes the `flyctl` CLI throw: `Error unknown flag: --build-arg GIT_REVISION`

```ts
const p = Deno.run({
  cmd: [
    "flyctl",
    "deploy",
    "--remote-only",
    "--no-cache",
    `--build-arg GIT_REVISION=${await getGitRevision()}`, // won't work
  ],
});
```

Which confused me as I actually expected I could just pass kinda any command even in a single string, though that's not the case as for example the following doesn't work either, or at least not as expected

```ts
const p = Deno.run({
  cmd: ["echo", "I love 🍉", "&&", "echo", "and 🍍"],
});
```

this prints

```bash
I love 🍉 && echo and 🍍
```

instead of

```bash
I love 🍉
and 🍍
```

Checking the [docs](https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.run)

> Spawns new subprocess. RunOptions must contain at a minimum the opt.cmd, an array of program arguments, **_the first of which is the binary_**.

"[..] the first of which is the binary.", so you can only spawn one command, which when thinking about it probably makes sense and things simpler and as we're already in-code it's no trouble running `Deno.run` as often as we like right 🥳

## How to properly pass argument values

So the solution to my initial problem is to put the value in it's own array item like in the following example

```ts
const p = Deno.run({
  cmd: [
    "flyctl",
    "deploy",
    "--remote-only",
    "--no-cache",
    "--build-arg",
    `GIT_REVISION=${await getGitRevision()}`,
  ],
});
```

## Get && commands working in Deno

```ts
function run(cmd: string) {
  let cmds: string[];
  if (cmd.includes("&&")) {
    cmds = cmd.split("&&").map((c) => c.trim());
  } else {
    cmds = [cmd];
  }
  const processes: Deno.Process[] = [];
  for (const index in cmds) {
    const command = cmds[index];
    const p = Deno.run({
      cmd: command.split(" "),
      stdout: "piped",
    });
    processes.push(p);
  }
  return processes;
}
```

Which you can use like so

```ts
const [p1, p2] = run("echo 'command 1' && echo 'command 2'");
await p1.status();
await p2.status();

// and to get the commands outputs
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
console.log(decoder.decode(await p1.output()).replace(/\n$/, ""));
console.log(decoder.decode(await p2.output()).replace(/\n$/, ""));
```

You could chain more of course or even `await Promise.all` and because `stdout` is set to `piped` can read the commands outputs, or remove `stdout` from `Deno.run` to have it print to your terminal without the need for `console.log`.

🦕😃

## Bonus: Get the current git revision hash

```ts
const getGitRevision = async () => {
  const p = await Deno.run({
    cmd: ["git", "rev-parse", "--short", "HEAD"],
    stdout: "piped",
  });
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  return decoder.decode(await p.output()).replace(/\n$/, "");
};
```
