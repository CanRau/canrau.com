# {frontmatter.title}

While finally trying to find a more convenient way to handle my dotfiles I stumbled upon the video [Git Bare Repository - A Better Way To Manage Dotfiles
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM) by DistroTube which is based on an [Atlassian tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

Before that I was almost about to give gnu stow a try, but I must say the bare repo feels kinda better to me than symlinking. In addition to that I learned interesting git stuff along the way. Especially using a bare repo like this ü§©

I'm tracking the steps I did for future reference and possibly others. Actually especially myself as I just realized I don't even remember how and when I installed the Go CLI, that happens way to often without documentation üòÖ

## Get Started

The Atlassian tutorial suggests the following

```bash
git init --bare $HOME/.cfg
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
echo "alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg/ --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

I store my dotfiles in `$HOME/.dotfiles`, skipped steps 2 & 3 and stored my alias manually in my [aliases] file and named it `dotfiles`.

After that I ran the `zsh` command to re-start it and make the aliases work right away.

Also I added more [aliases][aliases] as needed.

## iTerm setting to use

1. Open Preferences ||cmd+,||
2. General -> Preferences
3. Select the dotfiles iTerm directory
4. Check "Save changes to folder when iTerm2 quits"

My only issue right now is that `dotfiles add` won't auto-complete file/path names üôÅ
I googled around yet sadly none of the "solutions" worked. [^completions]

My current [dotfiles](https://github.com/CanRau/dotfiles) situation is still not exactly where I want it to be, but I'm happy I finally updated and therefore backuped some config files.

I'm super in love with [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) which was the main driver to update them üòÉ

Still missing are install scripts for apps, homebrew, macOS settings etc. I have them but not yet in the repo, I'll update this post when I update my dotfiles.
