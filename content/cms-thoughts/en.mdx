# {frontmatter.title}

{frontmatter.description}

## Table of contents

## Keystone JS

Kinda love it, though... ü§ì

- no "real" slug field? ü§î so how to query blog posts? only way seams a manual slug field or a custom field¬ø!
- dislike the slide-in pop-over when creating a new item, editing later is fine
- how to add images to wysiwyg¬ø?

Kay I just figured out a way of building it myself using [hooks](https://keystonejs.com/docs/guides/hooks)

```ts
export const lists: Lists = {
  Post: list({
    fields: {
      title: text(),
      slug: text({
        isIndexed: "unique",
      }),
    },
    hooks: {
      resolveInput: ({ resolvedData, item, inputData }) => {
        if (inputData.slug === "" || !item?.slug) {
          resolvedData.slug = resolvedData.title || item?.title || "";
        }
        if (resolvedData.slug) {
          resolvedData.slug = slugify(resolvedData.slug);
        }
        return resolvedData;
      },
    },
  }),
};
```

This behaves exactly as I think a `slug` field should. Initially (when empty) it'll be auto-populated on save from the title field. Later when updating the title it stays the same to not "break the site" but gives me the freedom to edit the slug however I see fit, or empty it to make it auto-generate from title field on save.

Also it should be possible to prevent it from changing if the item is already published, if that's a requirement, or send old, non-empty slugs to your redirection database to make sure it'll never end up in 404s.

I must say this hook system is really fantastic üëè

If I can now figure out how to add images to the `document` field (WYSIWYG) I might be convinced ü•∞.

## Strapi

Ridiculous field "styles", the widths aren't customizable and at least within Dynamic Zones most fields are half width ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's PHP, but I especially don't like the restriction on having only a "Single admin account" in the free version, although I kinda get the idea üòá

Best way to try it locally is [Craft Nitro](https://craftcms.com/docs/nitro), though I haven't actually tried it üòÖ
