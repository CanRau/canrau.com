## Implemented

### Skip Link

- [x] [Skip Link](#skip-link) â€” [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/), [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/screen-readers#hover-focus-and-other-states)

[Video by Kevin Powell about skip-links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDDaOFr9nqQ)

[Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:canrau.com) is a good example, not only do they provide a skip-link, but also an ["Accessibility help"](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/181196?hl=en-PE) and an ["Accessibility feedback"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:canrau.com#duf3=0,duf3-78,d3e) link

### Audio versions

So far only [1 article](/en/find-twitter-user-id) features an audio version you can listen to instead of reading the article, though I'm planning to record more articles whenever I can.

Though I'm still figuring out how to provide the best audio experience for coding tutorials which are (at least so far) the majority of my content. If you've got any ideas or insides please let me know via [@CanRau](https://twitter.com/@CanRau) or [PM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=59203844)

## On the roadmap

- Aria Labels
- "Accessibility help" linking to contact once implemented
