[Checklist - A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)

## Implemented

### Skip Link

- [x] [Skip Link](#skip-link) â€” [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/), [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/screen-readers#hover-focus-and-other-states)

[Video by Kevin Powell about skip-links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDDaOFr9nqQ)

[Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:canrau.com) is a good example, not only do they provide a skip-link, but also an ["Accessibility help"](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/181196?hl=en-PE) and an ["Accessibility feedback"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:canrau.com#duf3=0,duf3-78,d3e) link

## On the roadmap

- "Accessibility help" linking to contact once implemented
